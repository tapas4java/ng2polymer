# ng2start

A minimal [Angular2](https://angular.io/) starter using [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [SystemJS loader](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com)

## Install

Clone this repo and execute in your favourite shell:

* `npm i -g gulp` to install gulp globally (if you don't have it installed already)
* `npm i` to install local npm dependencies

## Run

After completing installation type in your favourite shell:

* `gulp serve` or just `gulp` to run your app in a new browser window. 
App files are observed and will be re-transpiled on each change. 
Also your SASS file changes will be transpiled to css and injected to your browser directly.
